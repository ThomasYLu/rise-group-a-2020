Project Question:
  While we have not finalized our research direction, our tentative research question is "How does conductivity of sodium ion channels influence likelihood of seizures?" 
  
Project Plan:
  Once we identify an appropriate model to use, we will focus on variables related to our research question and run multiple simulations testing different values. 
  By the end of 7/31, our goal is to arrive at a plausible research question supported more fully by our literature review (we have found some contradictions to resolve for our current question). Tentatively, we’d like to have a model running to generate data by Tuesday/Wednesday (depending on how tomorrow goes).

The majority of the studies we have found reference this study. We would be using this model as a base for the synchronization of excitatory and inhibitory signals that would induce a seizure. 

Questions/Feedback Requests:
  As of now, we are a bit unsure about the specific path we will take to study this general topic, however, we have many ideas that we believe will work. We discussed with Scott today the feasibility of possibly studying the effect of the conductance of sodium ion channels on the synchronization of excitatory and inhibitory signals during a seizure, but we aren’t sure what model we can use to study this; a study we discussed about this topic was the one conducted by Naze in 2015. I think the general help we need now is just guidance as to what direction to go with, as we have a decent number of ideas, but we aren’t particularly sure that they are feasible and we want to make sure whatever we research has future implications/ “means something”. It would nice to have some feedback on the general feasibility of what we are thinking of and if it is the proper level of complexity. Thank you!
